#  Quadratic Equation Solver (Discriminant Solver)

A simple Java application for solving quadratic and linear equations using the discriminant method.  
The code is organized into two separate classes: one for the program entry point and one for the mathematical calculations.

## How it works

- For a quadratic equation **ax² + bx + c = 0**:
  - Calculates the discriminant (**D = b² - 4ac**)
  - Outputs one or two roots, or a message if no real solutions exist
- Also supports:
  - Linear equations (when `a = 0`)
  - Special cases: infinite solutions or no solutions

## How to run

1. Navigate to the `src` folder
2. Compile the code:

javac Main.java DiscriminantSolver.java

Run the program:
   java Main
