# Java Encapsulation Example

This is a simple educational Java project that demonstrates the concept of **encapsulation**, a core principle of object-oriented programming (OOP). The project is designed as part of my learning journey and showcases how I structure code, apply logic, and comment on my implementation.

## What this project demonstrates

- **Encapsulation** using `private` fields and `public` getters/setters
- **Input validation** (e.g. checking for empty strings and negative numbers)
- **Basic method structure** with `void`, `String`, and `int` return types
- **Commenting and code readability**
- **Basic class usage and method calls in `main`**

## Concepts Practiced

- Declaring and using classes and objects
- Data hiding with `private` fields
- Using setter methods with validation logic
- Returning values with getter methods
- Printing output to the console
- Calculating remaining years to retirement with simple arithmetic

## Sample Output
User created.
My name is UserName, I am 23 years old
Show the value in the main method: UserName
Show the age in the main method: 23
Years lefts to retirement: 42


## Project Structure

```plaintext
Encapsulation.java

All logic is implemented in a single file for simplicity, including:

A Human class with fields: name and age
Getters and setters with validation
A speak() method to display a formatted message
A method to calculate years left until retirement (calculateYearsRetirement())
```

### Comments in Code
I’ve included inline comments (in both English and Ukrainian in some cases) to explain:

Why certain data types are used
What each method does
What validation checks are in place
These comments are meant to demonstrate not only technical knowledge, but also the ability to write code that others can read and understand.

### Requirements
Java SDK 8 or higher

Any Java IDE or simple text editor + terminal

## How to Run
Clone the repository or copy the code into a .java file (e.g. Encapsulation.java)

Compile the file:
javac Encapsulation.java
Run the compiled program:
java Encapsulation

### Key Takeaways for Employers
- Clean, self-documented code with meaningful comments
- Basic validation logic (empty string, negative numbers)
- Encapsulation best practices (`private` fields + getters/setters)
- Simple console I/O for quick demonstration


Project Purpose
This repository showcases my grasp of Java fundamentals and core OOP concepts, serving as a stepping-stone toward more sophisticated applications (e.g. FinTech services, backend APIs, user-driven console apps).
